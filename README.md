# BetterMinionRoulette

Better minion roulette plugin for FFXIV

Allows for a more granular approach to selecting the minions you want included in your minion roulette instead of the very binary "up to 30" and "EVERYTHING!!!!" options the game gives us.   
Also implements (or will implement) the ability to omit minions that are summoned on your island sanctuary.

## Limitations and known bugs

- After using the minion roulette, the next action with a cast time might temporarily display with the minion roulette icon and/or a wrong name. This is a visual bug only and does not affect gameplay.

## Roadmap

Things I intend to implement at some point in the future. Before posting a feature request, please make sure it's not already listed here:

- Minion Groups
  - For summoning a minion from a random group.
  - To treat as a single minion. Got 85 different flavours of "horse" but only the company chocobo otherwise? Put the horses in a group and treat it as a single minion for a 50/50 chance of getting "a random horse" or the chocobo.
- Summon criteria
  - Summon minion with specified number of seats (to move the whole party).
  - Summon minion with/without custom BGM.
  - Summon fastest minion (i.e. SDS Fenrir if owned and riding map not unlocked, random otherwise)
  - Maybe more
