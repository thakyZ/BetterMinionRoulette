# BetterMinionRoulette

Better minion roulette plugin for FFXIV

Allows for a more granular approach to selecting the minions you want included in your minion roulette instead of the very binary "up to 30" and "EVERYTHING!!!!" options the game gives us.
Also implements (or will implement) the ability to omit minions that are summoned on your island sanctuary.

## Limitations and known bugs

- After using the minion roulette, the next action with a cast time might temporarily display with the minion roulette icon and/or a wrong name. This is a visual bug only and does not affect gameplay.

## Roadmap

Things I intend to implement at some point in the future. Before posting a feature request, please make sure it's not already listed here:

- Island Sanctuary Blacklist
  - Disables the minions and forbids them from being enabled when summoned on the Island Sanctuary.
- Search function for the settings, so you can finally disable that one eyesore of a minion you just can't seem to find without it.
